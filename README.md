# Interactive R Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an analysis project conducted in R, focusing on various techniques for analyzing variables, internal data structure, variable importance, and cluster analysis. The dataset used includes labeled information about users who were either granted or denied a mortgage.

## Rmd File Features

The distinctive aspect of this project lies in the R Markdown (Rmd) file, which incorporates interactive Shiny cells throughout the document. These Shiny cells enhance the user's ability to interact with the analysis, providing a dynamic and engaging experience within the Rmd.

## Highlights

- In-depth analysis of variables.
- Exploration of data structure.
- Variable importance assessment.
- Cluster analysis based on user labels.

## Noteworthy Point

While the analyses are valuable, the main highlight is the innovative use of Shiny cells within the Rmd file. Throughout the project, it became evident that there was a lack of documentation on incorporating such interactive cells in an Rmd file, making this work stand out.

## Evaluation

The project received a commendable score of 10, reflecting the quality and innovation demonstrated in both the analysis and the utilization of interactive elements.

## Language

The entire project was conducted in Spanish, aligning with the language of the course in which it was undertaken.

Feel free to explore the Rmd file and interact with the Shiny cells to gain a deeper understanding of the analyses conducted. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy analyzing! :)
